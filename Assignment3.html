			A Kenyan man was stopped at Bangkok’s airport for allegedly trying to smuggle more 
			than 60 packets of cocaine in his stomach, Thai authorities announced Wednesday
			Authorities said Glenn Chibasellow Ooko, 43, had flown on Monday from Ethiopia to 
			the Thai capital’s Suvarnabhumi airport, where he was detained.

			An x-ray showed dozens of oblong items in his stomach, which were filled with cocaine, 
			according to photos provided by the Office of the Narcotics Control Board.
			“He swallowed cocaine weighing 1.2 kilograms, which were in 68 packets,” the ONCB 
			announced in a statement Wednesday.
			Ooko was arrested along with Nigerian national Osita Joseph Ukpa, who police said 
			had hired the Kenyan to smuggle the drugs.
